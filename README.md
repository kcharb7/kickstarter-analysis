More specifically, theater campaigns were most successful in June.

In the United States, successful plays had a median goal of $3,000 (IQR=$3,500), while failed plays had goals that were almost twice as high at $5,000 (IQR=$8,000). Not surprisingly, successful plays reached their goal through pledges (median=$3,168, IQR=$3,982), while failed plays had extremely low pledges (median=$103, IQR=$492). 

Looking at musicals in Great Britain, the median goal was $2,000, while the median pledged was half that. As such, Louise should aim to have a budget for her musical under $2,000.
